ML in 2025 
0. Think like an engineer. 
1. Diving deep into python. ( learning fundamentals, skipping all advanced theory, building automation projects as quickly as possible ) 
 - Scripting or scrapping 
 - Numpy 
 - Matplotlib 
 - Pandas 
 - Get competent working with data sets within python 
 - basics of API, how to make a very simple one and how to call api's from python 
 2. Become data literate 
 - learn basic sql queries 
 - some joins 
 - some select statements 
 - what actually is SQL? 
 - Pandas 
 - advanced operations 
 - be comfortable working with large sets of data 
 - visualising data 
 3. Start working with AI models immediately 
 - start working with OpenAI/API 
 - start working with Claude API 
 - start working with Ollama 
 - LangChain 
 - LangGraph 
 - building some basic AI agents 
 - vector databases 
 - retrieval augmented generation 
 - Building AI applications 
 - Working with Streamlit to building simple UI's and data dashboards 
 4. Learning The Core Machine Learning and AI Fundamentals ( taking a step back ) 
 - Start learning ML algorithms 
  - Regression 
  - classification 
  - clustering 
  - Start looking at libraries like scikit learn 
   - Learn how to implement machine learning algorithms 
   - Use them to build basic ML apps 
 - Start working with things like Neural networks 
 - Start learning basic computer vision stuff 
  - Start looking at libraries like pytorch and tensorflow 
5. LLMs and AI agents 
- Understand how an LLM works ( e.g. GPT ) 
- Understand the architecture ( at a high level ) 
- What can LLMs do? 
- What they ( LLMs ) cannot do? 
- black boxes 
- Learn to use No Code tools 
 - CrewAI 
 - Langflow
 - n8n 
 - VAPI 
 - Livekit 
- Learn about MCP servers 
 - what are those and how do those works? 
 - looking into a lot of AI code editors
